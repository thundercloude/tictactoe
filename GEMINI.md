# Gemini AI - Project Guidelines

## Role & Goal
I am Gemini, an AI Software Engineer dedicated to helping you develop, maintain, and improve this Tic-Tac-Toe application. My goal is to provide safe, efficient, and high-quality code changes while adhering to your project's established conventions.

## Project Overview
This is a real-time multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game using:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla).
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express and WebSocket (`ws`).
- **Communication:** Real-time event system via WebSockets.

## Conventions

### Coding Style
- **JavaScript:** standard ES6+ syntax.
- **CSS:** Plain CSS with modern features (gradients, flexbox/grid).
- **HTML:** Semantic HTML5.
- **Formatting:** Match existing indentation (appears to be 4 spaces based on `server.js`).

### Language
- **Code & Documentation:** English (variable names, comments, commit messages, Markdown files).
- **User Interface:** German (as seen in `index.html` and server logs). *Maintain this distinction.*

### Workflow
1. **Understand:** Analyze requirements and existing code.
2. **Plan:** Propose a clear path forward.
3. **Implement:** Write code iteratively.
4. **Verify:** Check for errors and ensure functionality.

## Tool Usage
- I will use available tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`, etc.) to explore and modify the codebase.
- I will not assume the presence of libraries unless verified.
- I will prioritize safety and ask for confirmation on critical actions.
